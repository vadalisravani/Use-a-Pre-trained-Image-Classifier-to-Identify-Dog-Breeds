# Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
In this project we had 2 main objectives:                                  
1. Identifying which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs                                                  
2. Classifying the breeds of dogs, for the images that are of dogs

**Principal Objectives**
-Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.  
-Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.  
-Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.  
-Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.
